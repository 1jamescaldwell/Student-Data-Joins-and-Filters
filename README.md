This script performs a task similar to a VLOOKUP in Excel. It merges data from two spreadsheets, adds a new column for graduation term information, and creates a new Excel file with the updated data. This script identifies students with matching student IDs between two Excel files: Graduated students raw.xlsx and Graduated students.xlsx. It then creates a new Excel file with additional information, specifically adding a column for the "Graduation Term Desc".
